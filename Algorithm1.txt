1. First make an list of 52 cards by cross joining of 4 suits(Heart, Diamond, Spade, Club) and 12 ranks(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A)
2. Shuffle the cards 
3. Divide these 52 cards between 2 players 
4. While player1_has_cards and player2_has_cards:
		a) player1 drawn a card (remove first element from the list)
		b) player2 drawn a card (remove first element from the list)
		c) compare their ranks (values)
			i) if both values(cards) are different in numbers(ranks)
				- then add these values to the list of winning player's list
			ii) if both values are same (same in rank) then it is a 'war' situation
			    - then according to the rule 'Each player removes 3 cards 'face down' and then one card face up'
			      so we will add top 3 values from list1 and top 3 values from list2 to a new list now this new list has 6 values
			    - now do something like step 4(a) and 4(b) and compare these values 
			      - add all these values(cards) to the list of winning player's list
		d) goto step 4 until either player1' list or player2's list has value(card) in their list(deck) 
		
5. Player with all 52 values(cards) is the winner
